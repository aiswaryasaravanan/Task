    <h1>Mac Mini</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p><b>Mac Mini</b> (stylized as <b>Mac mini</b>) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_form_factor_(desktop_and_motherboard)">small form factor</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer">desktop computer</a> developed and marketed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Mini">Apple Inc</a>. As of 2022, it is positioned between the consumer all-in-one <a href="Mac_Mini">iMac</a> and the professional Mac Studio and Mac Pro as one of four current Mac desktop computers. Since launch, it has shipped without a display, keyboard, and mouse. The machine was initially branded as "BYODKM" (Bring Your Own Display, Keyboard, and Mouse) as a strategic pitch to encourage users to switch from PCs running operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Linux.</p>
    <p>In January 2005, the original Mac Mini was introduced with the PowerPC G4 CPU. In February 2006, Apple announced the second-generation lineup. It featured more advanced components and internal software updates, and it switched the CPU to the Intel Core Solo. The third-generation, which was unveiled in June 2010, had a thinner, unibody aluminum case and an HDMI port, and was more readily positioned as a home theater device and an alternative to the Apple TV.</p>

    <p>The Mac Mini was modeled on the shape of a standard digital media player,<sup>[1]</sup> and runs the macOS operating system (previously Mac OS X and OS X).[2] It was initially advertised as "BYODKM" (Bring Your Own Display, Keyboard, and Mouse), aiming to expand Apple's market-share of customers using other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Linux.[3] Mac Mini was the company's only consumer computer that shipped without a paired display, keyboard, and mouse since its original release in 2005.[4][5]</p>

    <h2 id="First_generation">First generation (G4 Polycarbonate)</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Apple's release of a small form factor computer had been widely speculated upon and requested before the Mac Mini.[9] In January 2005, the Mac Mini G4 was introduced alongside the iPod shuffle at the Macworld Conference & Expo; Apple CEO Steve Jobs marketed "The cheapest, and most affordable Mac ever".[5][10] The machine was intended as an entry-level computer for budget-minded customers. In comparison to regular desktops, which use standard-sized components such as 3.5-inch hard drives and full-size DIMMs, the Mac Mini G4 uses low-power laptop components to fit into small cases and avoid overheating.[11]</p>
    <p>The aluminum case, the top and bottom of which is capped with polycarbonate plastic, has an optical drive slot on the front, and the I/O ports and vents for the cooling system on the back. It has an external 85W power supply.[12] Mac Mini G4 has no visible screws, reflecting Apple's intention the computer may not be upgraded by the user. Some Mac Mini owners used a putty knife or a pizza cutter to open the case to install third-party memory, which could be obtained less expensively than Apple's offering.[13]</p>

    <h4 id="Hardware"><b>Hardware</b></h4>
    <p>The Mac Mini G4 is based on a single-core, 32-bit, PowerPC CPU with 512 KB of on-chip L2 cache. The processor, running at 1.25, 1.33, 1.42, or 1.5 GHz depending on the model, accesses memory through a front-side bus clocked at 167 MHz. The CPU can be overclocked to higher frequencies by either soldering or desoldering certain zero-ohm resistors on the logic board.[14][15]</p>

    <h4 id="Connectivity_and_operating_systems">Connectivity and operating systems</h4>
    <p>The Mac Mini G4 has two USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port. Networking is supported with 10/100 Ethernet and a 56k V.92 modem, while 802.11b/g Wi-Fi and Bluetooth were additional, build-to-order options. External displays are supported via a DVI port, and adapters for VGA, S-Video, and composite video output were available. The system contains a built-in speaker and an 1/8-inch stereo mini jack for analog sound output. The new Wi-Fi card no longer used an MMCX-Female connector for the antenna, as do prior models, but rather a proprietary Apple one.[19]</p>

    <hr>
    <p>In February 2006, Apple announced the second-generation lineup of Mac Mini. Based on the Intel Core Solo CPU, it is four times faster than its predecessor PowerPC G4.[32][33] An updated server version of the machine was released in October 2009, having been marketed as an affordable server for small financial and academic uses; this model omitted the optical drive and used a hard drive instead.[34][35]</p>
